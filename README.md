DirLocker - system utility that lets people secure their confidential information using passwords. People will have access to the client program called locker in which they will see the list of protected folders and also they can add other folders as well. The number of folders to be added is not limited so is the number of symbols used in the password field. All passwords and paths to directories will be stored in some file in a secured format using special kind of encryption, called Salvador, created by me. More about how this encryption operates will be discussed in the next slide.
The utility name was taken as the concatenation of two words: Directory (dir in short) and Locker. It was fully written in Python programming language version 3.8.10.
